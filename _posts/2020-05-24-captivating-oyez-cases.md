Just a short note to point out some great Supreme Court cases I've been listening to the past few weeks after I discovered the audio transcripts are all available online. [Oyez](https://www.oyez.org/) has audio of most cases dating back all the way to the 1940s. 

The oral argument audio from these is quickly becoming my main podcast to listen to. I never realized how engaging the technicalities of legal process can be, it makes me want to study law. 

I have nothing particularly original to say about any of these cases that more competent constitutional commentators haven't already said.

If you want to learn more about any of these cases I've been reading opinions and summaries on [Casetext](https://casetext.com/). I wish more court records were available online for free, they are extremely entertaining to read.
