I was trying to pick up more Chinese business vocabulary the other day and after searching for a bit I realized that it is really hard to find many quality posts online. I realized that (in my opinion) the personal vocabulary phrasebook I made up for myself is better than most of what comes up in a search. 

Hopefully, this list here might be useful to some people who are looking for a rough list of verbs and nouns to expand their knowledge. Some of what is on here are not words that I would use but are maybe generally useful to know in case you hear someone else saying them to you. 

This list might have errors since I didn't run it by a native speaker, but I believe it to generally be correct.
