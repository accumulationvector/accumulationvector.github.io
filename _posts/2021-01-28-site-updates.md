What a hectic few months this has been. I haven't gotten much writing done and the site died for a minute there but everything should be back up now. I made some changes to make it much more viewable on mobile since that is apparently the method through which most people are viewing the site.

Instead of writing I have been working a lot more on programming and trying to get some startup ideas off the ground. I am very dismayed that nothing has been launched or reached the point where a landing page makes sense. I definitely bit off more than I could chew but there is finally a reasonable launch timeline on several projects that has me really excited.

At the moment I'm switching gears to do some writing about the things I've been working on and a couple of more instructional things. For a bit, I thought I would write about some current hot topics like tech censorship and secure communication infrastructure issues. Instead, it seems smarter to wait until the dust has cleared a bit to write about these issues. It is clear that a more decentralized and secure communication infrastructure is necessary but how this current round of censorship is going to play out is still up in the air.

I also have a couple of experimental pieces of theory that are going to hopefully get released under a few different imprints including one that is being started by [cryptolith](https://anarchitecturaldesign.org/). That is something to be on the lookout for; I'm still shopping for a place to publish the second.

The other article is going to be a collaboration talking about NLP data surveillance techniques and the current standards for anti-ML NLP methodology. In a [previous post](https://accumulationvector.com/2020-07-20/preliminary-notes-auth-ob), I created a partial bibliography about authorial obfuscation, which ties into the new work pretty well. I think that anti-linguistic forensics methods could be applied more widely to combat various NLP analysis techniques outside of authorial analysis.

The biggest change is that I'm going to be doing some live streams this next coming month of me just reading through some papers and other things. It should be fun and keep me more accountable to actually reading things instead of just skimming over them really quickly. I'm probably going to be doing this on twitch since the other platforms seem to have less audience. The link to my twitch channel is [here](https://www.twitch.tv/accumulationvector).

Finally, I will probably be doing a haphazard attempt at podcasting which is mostly going to consist of me doing goofy interviews and talking about cryptography infrastructure topics. Hopefully, it will pick up a bit of steam since tech censorship is becoming such a big issue lately. It might lean a bit too hard on the technical side. The audio for this is going to be posted [here](https://anchor.fm/accumulationvector).
