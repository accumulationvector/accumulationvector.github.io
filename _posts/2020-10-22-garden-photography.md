I was travelling a bit and came across a very beautiful conservatory garden to explore around in. I'm very happy with the photos I took of it but there are only a few.

While travelling I also stopped off at a weird little pond that was in the middle of an algae bloom that looked kind of charming. I'm sure if I had stopped off there at a different time it would have been less gross.
