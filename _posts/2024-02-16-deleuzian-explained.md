People tend to find it very difficult to understand what Deleuze is getting at when they attempt to read Deleuzian philosophy. In practice, it really isn't that hard to understand what it is about, there are lots of layers of obfuscation that cause it to be more difficult than it has to be. Talking to a friend the other day I was explaining Deleuze and I'm repeating much of what I said here for the benefit of others who are confused.

The key thing to takeaway from D&G is their focus on Desire as the key principle in all of philosophy. Their view boils down to the idea that everything in society, as well as all the structures of society, are essentially like plumbing/funnels to contain, repress, and restrict forms of raw desire.

Throughout their texts they quite literally use a kind of plumbing analogy throughout, in the form of 'libidinal flows'. For them, your flows of desire are put down the tracks that society lays down for you. The question you are supposed to ask in the face of this is: How do you escape from this mindset?

That is really all you need to understand their mode of analyzing society. The main factor they identify as the linchpin of control is psychology and in particular psychiatry as a key component in the restriction of desire. 

If you let your passion or desire or thought runaway in a way that is outside the confines of governance and societal structures restricting you, you are 'crazy' or 'criminal' for letting desire guide you rather than staying in the lanes society has laid down for you. 

The title of their texts is a representation of this 'Anti-Oedipus', they see themselves as being in a fight against psychology and psychiatry. For them, this as the ultimate form of  restricting you when you can't be restricted by society at large, when you go too wild. 

People often point out the overlap between Deleuze and Foucault, and it is true that  Foucault has much the same analysis. The difference here is that Focault always writes books that are more like history books, and he tells his philosophy through a critique of the development of societies institutions/frameworks. 

He goes through the history and reads his postmodern critique into that history. D&G boil everything down to 'desire is policed' and create an overarching critical system of society, and then they develop methods for how they think this can be overcome (Foucault does not really do this, he just speaks critically).
