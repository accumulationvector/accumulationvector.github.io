I have nothing to say about myself as a person, I try to be as decentered as humanly possible. I want to exist, but how I want to exist is uncertain.


- [Books](https://accumulationvector.com/books/)

Here is a book reading list of what I have been reading each year starting in 2024. Each of these will have a little page that might be just notes I took while reading the text or a full review. 

These are really just going to be my personal impressions on each thing and are not really going to be going very deep into the text. If I intend to go deeper into a given text I will probably write a full post about it or something else.


- [Supplements](https://accumulationvector.com/supplements/)

Here I am goign to post some writings of my thoughts on various supplements that I've tried over the years, several of these are weird or off brand supplements that I've tried and my opinions and thoughts on these.

In particular I have tried various forms of TCM that I think most people in the west have not tried or have very little experience with so these might be fun to list.
