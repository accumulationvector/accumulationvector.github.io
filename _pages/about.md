I have nothing to say about myself as a person, I try to be as decentered as humanly possible. I want to exist, but how I want to exist is uncertain.

- [Books](https://accumulationvector.com/books/)

This is a reading list of what I have been reading each year starting in 2024. Each book  will have a little page that might be just notes I took while reading the text or a short opinion.

These are really just going to be my personal impressions on each thing and are not really going to be going very deep into the text. If I intend to go deeper into a given text I will probably write a full post about it or something else.

- [Supplements](https://accumulationvector.com/supplements/)

Here I am going to post some of my thoughts on various supplements that I've tried over the years, several of these are pretty weird supplements.

In particular, I have tried various forms of TCM that I think most people in the west have not tried or have very little experience with.
