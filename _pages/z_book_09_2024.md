Small little text of various surrealist methodologies and games. The text has all the ones you have heard of before like The Exquisite Corpse and other similar tihngs. It had a whole pile of techniques that I hadn't heard of before that were somewhat engaging to read about.

I did not really see anything new or interesting that I felt like I would enjoy. None of these games really peaked my interest at all, they feel more like fun party games than anything that could be incorporated into any serious artistic practice.

The exposition and examples of people playing the games was not super engaging, none of them really sold me on the techniques being super fun, yielding any interesting results, or having been good as an artistic practice.

A lot of what was going on in the book is a bit annoying and hard to follow, I believe this was done on purpose. It was totally annoying
