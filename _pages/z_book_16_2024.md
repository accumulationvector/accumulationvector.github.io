This is a small little art volume of the pixel art work of Somnath Bhatt that was curated by Moad Musbahi. The way the authors weave the words of the text into the pixel art cutouts is really beautiful.

The artists work has been shown in quite a few places now and I would recommend checking it out. See the following [link](https://www.isagallery.org/exhibitions/heartbeats-of-a-cave) for one such show of similar work to the book.

The quality of some of the hanging work leaves a lot to be desired because the works are all inkjet on printer. Some of it is quite warped becasue of the way that the pieces were printed which makes them look a bit cheap.

The pixel art itself is some of the best I've ever seen though there is not enough abstract work that is done in a pixellated style like this.
