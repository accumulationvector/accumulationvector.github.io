Flann O'Brien is one of my favorite authors by far, so when I saw this at a book store for cheap I snatched it right up. This is one of the last books of his that I had left to read. At-Swim Two Birds is one of the best novels that ever read and stands out as something I often recommend to people along with The Third Policeman. Those are his most well known texts, and I have read both multiple times. They are just all around 10/10 surrealist works, some of the best and most engaging surrealist novels ever written. 

This on the other hand is not a great novel by any stretch of the imagination, and even as a fan of his, I have to admit this is probably the least interesting of his works. There are other texts such as The Dalkey Archive that do not stand up as well but that text is still of a high enough caliber to be worth recommending. This text on the other hand is sadly not. I would not recommend this to anyone except diehard fans of Flann O'Brien.

It is by far one of his least surrealist works, and is much more of a straightforward story written with dialog in his signature style. It definitely got several laughs out of me but it wasn't something I will probably ever want to recommend or return to.
