Not certain that I buy into the argument that Richard Florida is making here, and from what I've read I don't think that he buys into his own argument anymore. He seems to have walked back many of the key points he has put forward in the book in later years.

That said, this was worth reading for the graphs and dataset analysis on various cities in the US alone. It is a great showcase of some awesome datasets all in one place. I was very fascinated by all of the data in this book.

Not really sure I had much other thought related to this. I think it is generally true that many towns and cities have different typese of setups and situations that are attuned to certain types of people. By that I mean, certain elements attract certain types of people and repel others. This is pretty straightforward as far as claims go, it is all the other things that are tacked onto this pretty straightforward claim that end up being contentious.

The entire thesis of this book, that stimulating the creative class causes cities to grow in economically meaningful ways, is quite weird. From the perspective of a somewhat artistic person, most attempts that cities make to follow this type of branding and advice end up failing. The astroturfed methodology that is frequently cited simply does not work. The types of creativity that is safe, sanitized, and voted on by committee for a general public is not the types of things that make a city interesting to live in.

It doesn't really matter how many public art murals you commission or how many symphonic institutes you give grants to, these kinds of stimulus don't actually do anything to attract the creative class to a given area. Instead they feel tepid and lame. The way creative or hipster groups evolve usually comes about in at least a somewhat organic fashion. It is often a matter of being in the right place at the right time with several strong personalities that have disposable income. It is often a lot more personality driven behind the scenes than anyone ever imagines.
