Not certain that I buy into the argument that Richard Florida is making here, and from what I've read I don't think that he buys into his own argument anymore. He seems to have walked back many of the key points he has put forward in the book in later years.

That said, this was worth reading for the graphs and dataset analysis on various cities in the US alone. It is a great showcase of some awesome datasets all in one place. I was very fascinated by all of the data in this book.
