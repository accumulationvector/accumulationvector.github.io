Here is just a list of nootropics and supplements I've tried at various times and my opinion on these. Some of these I've taken only a few times or over the course of a single month and other things I have attempted to take over much longer periods of time. 

So not all of these are things that I am currently taking, and even those things that I am currently taking, some of them are very sporadic and mixed. I don't have any long-term data on most of these because I am not super strict about my regimen. If you want that kind of data look elsewhere. 

A lot of this is honestly pretty standard, like my opinion on Vitamin C is probably not going to radically reinvent the wheel. The main thing of interest for most people reading this is the fact that there are several substances here that have very little information online, or very few people have taken. 

I have gone out of my way to try weird substances that are pretty far off the beaten path, some of them for long periods of time, and some of which caused adverse reactions (particularly TCM medications I've tried). As I add to this list, I'm going to try to place these in order of those which are most novel towards the top and those less novel toward the bottom so as to not waste peoples time.

Here is a first draft of a few that I will fill out later, most TCM is left off for now until I take them out of the box.

## Oxytocin

I have taken Oxytocin in both a pill form and as a nasal spray. From my own research and my own experiences I can say without a doubt that the pill form does not appear to do anything.

It doesn't seem able to cross the blood-brain barrier in pill form. Despite that I took 90 of the pills to see if there would be any impact, but there was no noticable impact.

The nasal spray however does appear to have a strong effect. It wasn't strong enough to tell that it wasn't just placebo but I definitely felt more social and forming bonds or empathizing with other people seem much easier.

The spray seemed to last for around 1 hour as far as I could tell, and was quite a strong effect. I would definitely recommend trying it out, as it did appear to have a slight effect on my overall disposition while I was on it.

## Estradiol

There was a three month period when I experimented with taking 2mg of estrogen daily, with great results overall. I would definitely consider taking more of it in the future or possibly taking one of the non-feminizing variants. It definitely makes you more emotional overall, which is a net negative side effect.

All other side effects were positive, it made me calmer, gave me an interesting peace of mind. I was able to work more effectively and though it created emotional swings in either direction, the happy emotional cycles were very strong and long lasting. It also significantly reduces libido, which depending on the person might be a good or bad side effect.

The data on taking estrogen or anti-testosterone medication as a life extension mechanism is really inconclusive so I'm not sure if I would take it again in the future for that purpose. Overall it seemed like a net positive.

## Pinus Massoniana (Chinese Pine Needles)

There was quite a strong effect with this one and ended up being quite a story. Each time I took the pinecone dust I immediately felt sick to my stomach and around the fifth day of taking the pinecone I got so sick that I started violently puking. The vomit appeared a bright red and seemed to have blood in it. A friend proceeded to call an ambulance on me that I did not go into.

After puking and no longer taking the supplement I had no futher issues whatsoever. It definitely had a strong effect. To be fair, I'm not sure if it was the actual pinecone or some contaminant in the supplement (which is not unheard of in TCM manufacturing). Either way I would not recommend trying this supplement to anyone.

## Ashwaganda



## Nicotine (Gum)

I have taken nicotine gum for around 2 years on and off at various points. The main thing that inspired me to try it was the [excellent post by Gwern]() and I have since gone on to encourage many friends to give it a try. I have never been a smoker or a vape person prior to using nicotine gum. It is definitely the best low effect stimulant, and targets different neural pathways than caffeine. I would describe it as most similar to an extremely microdose of Adderall. 

Daily at my peaks in my habit I take around 24-36mg of nicotine. I would say this is an extremely high dose much higher than the Gwern post for example recommends. At strong doses like this it causes a very strong heart impact and makes my heart feel slightly strained (I am not in the best health). It is never enough to impact my performance except during strenuous workouts. If I stop taking it for a day or more this goes away entirely and does not seem long-lasting.

In terms of my teeth, I don't see any impact on my tooth health from taking nicotine gum for years. My gums and teeth seem roughly the same as before I started taking it. There has been no significant difference in my gum health, there have been several studies which seem to show an impact on gum health, but I have not experienced this at all with long-term use.

The gum also seems significantly less addictive than other forms of nicotine. I have not smoked really so I can't speak to how addictive smoing is, but I feel like the addiction is mostly psychological. 

There have been several times when I stop for a 1-3 months mostly just to see if I can, and I have not found any significant addictive behavior crop up. I have also randomly stopped for shorter periods like a week with no significant cravings after the first day or two. 

I do not take nicotine while I'm travelling, so anytime I travel I go without it for weeks at a time with no real notice other than obviously less wakefulness. All in all, I have found caffeine much more addictive ironically. Often, I feel completely incapable of going without caffeine for even a day or two without a significant cravings.

## Chlorophyll

This is a total meme, no quantity of it seems to do anything whatsoever. I suspected as much going in but I took it as a joke around my friends saying I was going 'plant mode' over and over again. The most value you can get out of this is taking it as a joke.

## Bacopa Monnieri

Bacopa is supposedly used as a form of anti dementia drug. I bought a raw powder form of this and took it over the course of around 2 months and saw no improvements whatsoever. 

It did not seem to do anything and I did not even get a placebo effect out of taking it, at least not one that I could tell. I do not believe it does anything whatsoever and have not taken any of it since.

## Spirulina

## Phenylpiracetam

## Zinc

Everytime I take Zinc supplements it causes me to become extremely nausous and feel like I am going to puke, they make me very very sick in most cases. I have read that this is a common issue for many people and that it can cause stomach ulcers to form. 

The dosage I take that causes this is around 50mg which equates to around 500% of a persons daily value. When I take it at lower quantitites I have felt significant bodily effects, but at higher dosages I simply cannot tolerate it. 

## Collagen

## Biotin

## CoQ10

This one is kind of weird I took tablets of CoQ10 for around 3 or 4 months and saw what I believe to simply be a placebo effect. I took this during a time that I was going to a personal trainer and I did feel like it was doing something but it was difficult to put my finger on what exactly. 

I think that it is generally recommended to be taken with something else in order to properly 'activate' it similar to choline. I did not take it how you are supposed to I just took it everyday before going to work out and do stretches. It did not generate enough of an effect to warrant me taking it further.

## L-Theanine

## Kratom

This is probably a useless drug.

## Caffeine

I take caffeine pills multiple times a day every single day. These are roughly around 200mg and I have taken several different variants. The kind that comes from Walmart ironically is the best brand for caffeine tablets in my opinion, you can break them in half very easily. This is by far the best over the counter stimulant besides nicotine that I'm aware of. 

Everyone is already well aware of the upsides of caffeine but I will note that if you are taking it in an energy drink or in the form of coffee you are getting ripped off. The price per 200mg is roughly less than 0.05USD and taking it any other way besides in pill or powder form is just a total waste of your money.

## Melatonin

Cannot wake up from this regardless of the dosage. It ruins my day the next day and makes me incredibly sleepy even after I wake up from it. I have tried it many times because everyone in the community swears by it and its ability to give someone a good nights rest. What I've found is that it does in fact cause you to get sleepy after taking it, I've tried it at dosages of 1mg, 2mg, 3mg, 5mg, 10mg, and 20mg. 

Each of these dosages causes me to get sleepy and fall asleep. Though high dosages like 20mg cause me to sometimes have some weird effect where I am deliriously tired, feel as though I am dreaming or in and out of consciousness, but cannot fall asleep. These high dosages often make me feel like I didn't sleep at all the whole night. 

When I take it at a lower dosage, I fall asleep very very fast and sleep through the whole night without issue. I naturally wake up after around 8 hours of sleep when taking lower dosages. The issue as I mentioned above is that even on lower dosages I wake up and after around an hour I feel very sleepy still like the drug is not fully out of my system. 

I will feel horribly tired even after taking caffeine and often fall back asleep after an hour or two and sleep another 3-4 hours. Upon waking up from this I have then overslept and feel sleepy from that. So given this, I'm not really sure what to make of the drug or if I am just using it wrong because it seems to work too well on me if anything and does not wear off after 8 or 9 hours.

## Adderall (prescribed)

Adderall is simply the best drug ever created, there is nothing to be said that hasn't already been said by anyone else. It is the best nootropic, if you get the chance take it.

Personally, I stopped taking it when I learned of the potential neurotoxic effects from taking it. It is worth taking sparingly, and I took it daily for years at a time.

## Vitamin C

I take a lot of vitamin C because I have mostly removed all fruit from my diet. I have attempted to remove all sugars and most breads from my diet as much as is reasonable anyway. I rarely ever eat any sugary foods, fruit, candy, pastries, etc. I also do not drink any sugary drinks for the most part. I never drink soda under almost any circumstances. 

Since this is the case, I feel the need to make it up by taking vitamin C. I don't really feel much of an impact from taking the vitamin C, but I take it regardless anyway at a rate of around 250-500mg per day.
