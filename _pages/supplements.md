Here is just a list of nootropics and supplements I've tried at various times and my opinion on these. Some of these I've taken only a few times or over the course of a single month and other things I have attempted to take over much longer periods of time. So not all of these are things that I am currently taking, and even those things that I am currently taking, some of them are very sporadic and mixed. I don't have any long-term data on most of these because I am not super strict about my regimen. If you want that kind of data look elsewhere. 

A lot of this is honestly pretty standard, like my opinion on Vitamin C is probably not going to radically reinvent the wheel. The main thing of interest for most people reading this is the fact that there are several substances here that have very little information online, or very few people have taken. I have gone out of my way to try weird substances that are pretty far off the beaten path, some of them for long periods of time, and some of which caused adverse reactions (particularly TCM medications I've tried). As I add to this list, I'm going to try to place these in order of those which are most novel towards the top and those less novel toward the bottom so as to not waste peoples time.

Here is a first draft of a few that I will fill out later

## Oxytocin

I have taken Oxytocin in both a pill form and as a nasal spray.

## Estrodiol

## Pinus Massoniana (Chinese Pine Needles)

## Ashwaganda

## Nicotine (Gum)

I have taken nicotine gum for around 2 years on and off at various points. The main thing that inspired me to try it was the excellent post by Gwern and I have since gone on to encourage many friends to give it a try. I have never been a smoker or a vape person prior to using nicotine gum. 

## Chlorophyll

## Bacopa Monnieri

Does not work. 

## Spirulina

## Phenylpiracetam


## Zinc

Everytime I take Zinc supplements it causes me to become extremely nausous and feel like I am going to puke, they make me very very sick in most cases. I have read that this is a common issue for many people and that 

## Collagen

## Biotin

## CoQ10

## L-Theanine

## Caffeine

I take caffeine pills multiple times a day every single day. These are roughly around 200mg and I have taken several different variants. The kind that comes from Walmart ironically is the best brand for caffeine tablets in my opinion, you can break them in half very easily. This is by far the best over the counter stimulant besides nicotine that I'm aware of.

## Melatonin

Cannot wake up from this regardless of the dosage. It ruins my day the next day and makes me incredibly sleepy even after I wake up from it. I have tried it many times because everyone in the community swears by it and its ability to give someone a good nights rest. 

## Adderall (prescribed)

## Vitamin C

I take a lot of vitamin C because I have mostly removed all fruit from my diet. I have attempted to remove all sugars and most breads from my diet as much as is reasonable anyway. I rarely ever eat any sugary foods, fruit, candy, pastries, etc. I also do not drink any sugary drinks for the most part. I never drink soda under almost any circumstances.
