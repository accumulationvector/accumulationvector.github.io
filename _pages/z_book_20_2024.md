My friend picked this special edition up from the store the other day it is an art book of the borderline show by Acky Bright. I won't show any excerpts here because of obvious copyright issuse so if you want to see the exhibition check out [this link](https://www.acky-bright.com/works-borderline).

It is just some cyberpunk anime style of artwork. It is a great style but I don't have that much to say about this beyond recommending it. I had a short discussion about the possibility of recreating this type of work in a 3d space via scanning. Nothing else to say.
