On past sites, I have just had a static linkroll on the side of a page but this time I wanted to try something different. Here I will add interesting links that I have been looking at or thinking about each month. For links that require longer commentary, I might make an individual post.

These are in reverse chronological order.

- [Traffic Confirmation Attacks Despite Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.04893) - [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.04893.pdf)<br>
>We propose a traffic confirmation attack on low-latency mix networks based on computing robust real-time binary hashes of network traffic flows. Firstly, we adapt the Coskun-Memon Algorithm to construct hashes that can withstand network impairments to allow fast matching of network flows. The resulting attack has a low startup cost and achieves a true positive match rate of 80% when matching one flow out of 9000 with less than 2% false positives, showing traffic confirmation attacks can be highly accurate even when only part of the network traffic flow is seen.<br>

- [Opportunistic multi-party shuffling for data reporting privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.05273) - [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.05273.pdf)<br>
>An important feature of data collection frameworks, in which voluntary participants are involved, is that of privacy. Besides data encryption, which protects the data from third parties in case the communication channel is compromised, there are schemes to obfuscate the data and thus provide some anonymity in the data itself, as well as schemes that 'mix' the data to prevent tracing the data back to the source by using network identifiers.<br> <br>This mixing is usually implemented by utilizing special mix networks in the data collection framework. In this paper we focus on schemes for mixing the data where the participants do not need to trust the mix network or the data collector with hiding the source of the data so that we can evaluate the efficacy of peer to peer mixing strategies in the real world.<br>

>We study a set of high-profile scams that were well engineered and have hit people hard in China in recent years. We propose a simple but novel theoretical framework to examine psychological, situational and social fabric factors that have played a role in these scams. We also use this framework as a tool to explore scam countermeasures. In so doing, we identify how these Chinese scams differ from their Western counterparts.<br>

>Users of an onion routing network, such as Tor, depend on its anonymity properties. However, especially malicious entry nodes, which know the client’s identity, can also observe the whole communication on their link to the client and, thus, conduct several de-anonymization attacks. To limit this exposure and to impede corresponding attacks, we propose to multipath traffic between the client and the middle node to reduce the information an attacker can obtain at a single vantage point.<br>

>In the not-so-distant past, darknet markets like the Silk Road were the cutting-edge in transactional freedom. Today, that model is already obsolete, displaced by a more decentralized alternative called "drop gangs." Drop gangs use invite-only encrypted chatrooms to connect buyers with sellers, who then "dead drop" the wares in a public place where the buyer later retrieves.<br>

It is IMPOSSIBLE for myself and the other participants to prove to a third party that we did not collude to keep the secret key. If you do not believe you can trust me, you should stop reading now.<br>

Silence is a virtue, especially when under interrogation. We will try to show why no one should try to talk their way out of it and how the moment the subject engages is the moment he loses control.<br>

>Premeditated war between the United States and China is very unlikely, but the danger that a mishandled crisis could trigger hostilities cannot be ignored. Thus, while neither state wants war, both states' militaries have plans to fight one. As Chinese anti-access and area-denial (A2AD) capabilities improve, the United States can no longer be so certain that war would follow its plan and lead to decisive victory. This analysis illuminates various paths a war with China could take and their possible consequences.<br>

>Larry Harmon was arrested earlier this week for allegedly participating in a money-laundering conspiracy worth more than $300 million in cryptocurrency involving darknet marketplace AlphaBay. However, the family of the Coin Ninja CEO claims he was never involved with AlphaBay.<br><br>
Many bitcoin experts are concerned this could establish a precedent where simply creating a bitcoin mixer is seen, in itself, as a money-laundering conspiracy. <br><br>
The public policy group Coin Center argued non-custodial mixers should not be subject to regulation because they offer user-hosted software tools. Only time will tell if the court agrees this reduces the developer's liability.

This research paper examines several platforms, including chat programs, self-hosted chat clients, and social networks. For each platform, we tested the unique possibility of using its API as a C&C server. We also explored if these chat platforms are already being abused by known malware.<br>

>If we encounter an executable binary sample in the wild, what can we learn from it? In this work, we show that the programmer’s stylistic fingerprint, or coding style, is preserved in the compilation process and can be extracted from the executable binary. This means that it may be possible to infer the programmer’s identity if we have a set of known potential candidate programmers, along with executable binary samples (or source code) known to be authored by these candidates.<br>
