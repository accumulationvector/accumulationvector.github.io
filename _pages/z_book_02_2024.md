Eumeswil is quite an annoying book to attempt to read. One of the main things that brings people to this book, and the reason why I was taking a second crack at it was that it is one of the few texts which invokes a philosophical notion of the 'anarch'. This particular notion of individualist anarchism is pretty rare at least in the way Junger places it. The story is not very interesting at all, and honestly acts as a vehicle for the ideas that it puts out. The issue is that there isn't that much philosophical content in this. There isn't much story based content either. It is a major let down that does not actually fulfil either category well. I feel like its stature in the literary community is that it is one of the few fiction texts that puts forward a really coherrent vision of individualist anarchy that is totally devoid of leftism.

A lot of missed opportunity here, and a complete letdown in terms of what it could have been.
